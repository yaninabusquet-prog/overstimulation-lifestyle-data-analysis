# Overstimulation & Lifestyle Patterns
### Exploratory Data Analysis on Mental Wellbeing Factors

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between modern lifestyle habits and mental overstimulation using a synthetic dataset of 2,000 individuals and 15 behavioral and lifestyle variables.

The analysis focuses on identifying patterns and associations between overstimulation and factors such as screen time, working hours, stress levels, sleep quality, noise exposure, caffeine consumption, multitasking, physical activity and meditation practices.

## 🎯 Objective
The main goal is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to:
- Understand how lifestyle factors relate to mental overstimulation
- Test relevant hypotheses based on existing literature
- Identify potential risk and protective factors
- Lay the groundwork for future predictive modeling

## 📊 Dataset
- **Observations:** 2,000 individuals  
- **Features:** 15 lifestyle and behavioral variables  
- **Target variable:** Overstimulation (binary: 1 = Yes, 0 = No)  
- **Type:** Synthetic dataset (for educational and modeling purposes)

The dataset includes both risk factors (e.g. stress, screen time, noise exposure) and protective behaviors (e.g. exercise, meditation).

## 🧠 Key Questions & Hypotheses
- Is there a negative relationship between modern lifestyles and mental wellbeing?
- Do longer working hours and increased screen time raise the probability of overstimulation?
- Are high levels of social interaction and noise exposure associated with higher overstimulation?
- Do meditation and physical exercise reduce the likelihood of overstimulation?

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics
- Visual analysis of variable relationships
- Hypothesis-driven exploration

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📈 Key Insights
- Lifestyle intensity indicators (screen time, stress, working hours) show strong associations with overstimulation.
- Protective behaviors such as exercise and meditation are linked to lower overstimulation levels.
- The dataset enables a multifactorial perspective combining physical, mental and social dimensions.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- The dataset is synthetic and does not represent real individuals.
- Results are exploratory and require external validation for real-world applications.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Feature engineering
- Predictive modeling (classification)
- Model evaluation and interpretation
- Potential monitoring or early-warning frameworks
